# Chapter 1: The Role of Algorithms in Computing

---

###Definitions:

**Algorithm**
: An algorithm is any well-defined computational procedure that takes input and produces output.

**Instance of a problem**
: Actual case you're trying to solve.
It consists of the input needed to compute a solution to the problem.

**Data Structure**
: Data Structure is a way to store and organize data in order to facilitate access and modifications.
No single data structure works well for all purposes.</br></br>

### Notes:

- An algorithm is said to be correct if for every input instance, it halts with the correct output.</br></br>

- An incorrect algorithms can sometimes be useful.</br></br>

- Even an application that does not require algorithmic content at the application level relies heavily on algorithms.
